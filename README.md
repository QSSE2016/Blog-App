# Blog App

This is a blog application (ASP .NET CORE + Angular) where users can register,login (with hashed passwords),
create,edit,delete and view blogs. This is a showcase of a bunch of skills i have acquired during my time
learning ASP .NET Core and is not meant to be serious.

In fact, there's quite a bit of spaghetti code and poor error handling. However i have included tons of comments
to make sure that it's clear that i know that some parts of the code are bad, but i don't have the 
motivation to fix it. 

If you're interested in trying it out, feel free to pull it and make sure you put the correct server name for your (presumably) local SQL Server (from Microsoft). I think you also have to run migrations and re-install packages, but that's on visual studio and microsoft, not on me. 

Rant Over.
